# Estimation approach

<Consider the EZShop project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

## Estimate by product decomposition

| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                      | 12                                       |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                           | 200 LOC                                  |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                       | 2400 LOC                                 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                   | 240 Person Hours                         |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                    | 7200 â‚¬                                   |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week) | 240/(4*8) = 7.5 days = 1weeks + 2.5days  |
